# Leetcode exercises

This is a collection of all my **leetcode solutions**

if you want to try for yourself https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/

Most Files contain finished working solutions, if it isn't an accepted solution then I probably wrote that on the last commit of that file.

**Every commit** is a somewhat **different implementation** of that problem so you can see the mental process behind my final solution.

I've used the [vs code leetcode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LeetCode.vscode-leetcode) extension
and [vscode debug leetcode](https://github.com/wangtao0101/vscode-debug-leetcode) to debug my solutions
